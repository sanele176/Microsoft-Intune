To auto-sync OneDrive on Windows devices managed by Intune, 
you can configure a Device Configuration Profile that sets up OneDrive to automatically sign in and sync known folders (like Desktop, 
Documents, and Pictures). This is commonly done using Group Policy settings via Intune.

âœ… Steps to Auto-Sync OneDrive via Intune
1. Go to Intune Admin Center
URL: https://intune.microsoft.com
2. Create a Configuration Profile
Platform: Windows 10 and later
Profile type: Settings catalog
3. Configure OneDrive Settings
In the Settings picker, search for and add the following:

Setting	Value
Silently sign in users to the OneDrive sync app with their Windows credentials	Enabled
Silently move Windows known folders to OneDrive	Enabled
Prevent users from redirecting their Windows known folders to other locations	Enabled
Prompt users to move Windows known folders to OneDrive	Disabled
Use OneDrive Files On-Demand	Enabled
These settings ensure OneDrive auto-signs in and starts syncing folders without user interaction.

4. Assign the Profile
Assign it to the appropriate device group or user group.
ðŸ§  Notes
Make sure users have OneDrive installed and are licensed for OneDrive for Business.
You can also deploy the OneDrive client via Intune if needed.
